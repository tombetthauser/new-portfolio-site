    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>I'm an educator, multimedia artist and software engineer currently working as a full-stack platform engineer and instructor 
    at one of the worlds most competative software engineering bootcamps.
    Outside of my official employment I continue to maintain my visual art practice as an ongoing resident artist at the Verge Center for the Arts in Sacramento
    California.</p>

    <p>Before transitioning to my career as a software engineer I taught painting, life drawing, multimedia arts and art
    history at a number of colleges in Northern and Southern California for the better part of a decade. Prior to this I
    worked as a TA at the Yale School of Art where I received my MFA and at the San Francisco Art Institute where I received
    my BFA.</p>

    <p>Creating online resources for visual artists is one of my greatest passions and it has become an integral part of my
    studio practice. Projects like the State of the Arts Survey (see below) have provided me invaluable opportunities to
    collaborate and grow as an artist, and I look forward to continue expanding and promoting these projects in the coming
    years.</p>
